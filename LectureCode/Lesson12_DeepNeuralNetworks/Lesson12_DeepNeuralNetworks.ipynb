    "## 1. Multi-layer Neural Networks\n",
    "In this lesson, you'll learn how to build multilayer neural networks with TensorFlow. Adding a hidden layer to a network allows it to model more complex functions. Also, using a non-linear activation function on the hidden layer lets it model non-linear functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you'll see how a ReLU hidden layer is implemented in TensorFlow.   \n",
    "    **Note**: Depicted above is a \"2-layer\" neural network:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first layer effectively consists of the set of weights and biases applied to X and passed through ReLUs. The output of this layer is fed to the next one, but is not observable outside the network, hence it is known as a hidden layer.\n",
    "2. The second layer consists of the weights and biases applied to these intermediate outputs, followed by the softmax function to generate probabilities.\n",

    "\n",
    "### ReLU\n",
    "A **Rectified linear unit (ReLU)** is type of [activation function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activation_function) that is defined as `f(x) = max(0, x)`. The function returns 0 if `x` is negative, otherwise it returns `x`. TensorFlow provides the ReLU function as `tf.nn.relu()`, as shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Hidden Layer with ReLU activation function\n",
    "hidden_layer = tf.add(tf.matmul(features, hidden_weights), hidden_biases)\n",
    "hidden_layer = tf.nn.relu(hidden_layer)\n",
    "\n",
    "output = tf.add(tf.matmul(hidden_layer, output_weights), output_biases)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The above code applies the `tf.nn.relu()` function to the `hidden_layer`, effectively turning off any negative weights and acting like an on/off switch. Adding additional layers, like the `output` layer, after an activation function turns the model into a nonlinear function. This nonlinearity allows the network to solve more complex problems.\n",
